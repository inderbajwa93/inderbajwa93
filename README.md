- 👋 Hi, I’m @inderbajwa93
- 👀 I’m an amateur who is just starting his coding journey. I have a background in finance and real estate but lately have developed a strong motivation to learn how to code. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning basics of web development 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate - Do not have an answer for that yet but I am sure I will have many questions as i make my way through the learning curve. Will be more than happy to answer any questions related to real estate finance (in my limited capacity and knowledge)
- 📫 How to reach me - please feel free to drop a message.
